            <h2>Binomial</h2>
            <p>A binomial A/B test involves outcomes that 
                can be categorized into two distinct groups, 
                such as "success" or "failure," making it suitable  for conversion rate tests where the outcome is binary. </p>

        <div class="test-type">
            <h2>Non-Binomial</h2>
            <p>Non-binomial A/B testing is used when the outcomes cannot be neatly divided into two categories and might involve multiple variables or continuous data, such as the amount of time spent on a page or the total revenue generated.</p>

            <p>This type of testing is more complex and requires different statistical methods to analyze the results, as it deals with a range of outcomes rather than a simple yes/no scenario.</p>
